  (text "Version 1.8.1\nFirst layout for the China CM4 case by RelayTrust. This design\nis based on the 2 board solution of 1.7.4 but wrapped into a \nsingle, 6 layer, dual sided board.\n\nVersion 1.8.2\nUpdate of 1.8.1 with corrections to the following:\n- Push buttons were on the wrong side of the board\n- Locations of battery minus teerminals were incorrect\n- Traces of battery minus connections were insufficient to\n  carry the required current\n- USB-C cannot be easily used for communication so is now \n  strictly a power port (simplifying usb circuitry)\n- Added back the ethernet jack formerly removed because of\n  space considerations\n- Move location of J4 back slightly to align front of \n  connector with edge of board\n- Change board text of LED5 & LED8 to indicate correct colors\n\n \nVersion 1.8.3\nUpdate of 1.8.2 with modified ATTiny88 functionality\n- Fix error of ATTiny88 GND (s.b. to PWR_GND)\n- ATTiny88 always powered (via direct connect to battery +)\n- PB1 sensed by ATTiny88 for turn on/off (rather than AXP209)\n  to give better control\n- Change value of R7 to 10K to ensure battery 1 selection\n- Move U6 away from OLED for better clearance\n\n "
